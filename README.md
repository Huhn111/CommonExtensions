# CommonExtensions

This is a nuget-package / C# libary with common extensions. It's open source on GitHub and available in the default nuget-galllery nuget.org. The CI/CD pipeline is set up to publish a push to master automatically to the nuget-gallery. If you have a good idea for a new extension method go to GitHub and participate in the project.
